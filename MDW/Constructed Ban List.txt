Constructed format is where you can choose whatever cards you want out of the entire deck for your hand.
Here is a ban list for what cards you cannot choose for this to avoid unfun playstyles and overly broken combos.
You may also only have one of each item in your hand.
Each player can also choose one 3 star or lower field item to be active in the shop at the start of the game (besides banned ones, obviously)
